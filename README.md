Room Page (Authenticated)

Book Room Page (Authenticated)

Confirm Payment Page ( Dummy Page)

All of these pages are fully authenticated and functional using Node Js as the backend and MongoDB as the server.

On the Backend

We have authentication API's which have been implemented using JWT.

I have used the refresh token concept and stored the refresh token in the Cookie as it protects our against XSS attacks.

We have,

Host related API's

User related API's

Bookings related API's

On the database we store this data in the MongoDb database

Suitable relationships have been formed to cater the needs of the project.
